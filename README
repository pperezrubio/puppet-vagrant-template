This is a sample project showing how to create an environment of two servers provisioned by puppet

Use vagrant up to create the virtual machines and "vagrant ssh demo1" or "vagrant ssh demo2" to connect to them.

Each machine has shared folders pointing to host machine:

    /vagrant -> "." of the host server
    /tmp/vagrant-puppet/manifests -> ./manifests 
    /tmp/vagrant-puppet/modules-0 -> ./modules

The last two are defined by the setting in Vagrantfile

    demo1_puppet.pp_path = "/tmp/vagrant-puppet"
    demo1_puppet.manifests_path = "manifests"
    demo1_puppet.module_path = "modules"


After editing any recipe you can you 'puppet provision <server>' to apply the changes.


When done, we can destroy the VM using "vagrant destroy"
